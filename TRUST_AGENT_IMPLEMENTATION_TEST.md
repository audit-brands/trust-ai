# Trust Agent Implementation Test

## Test Summary
This document verifies that the trust agent has been properly implemented in forge.default.yaml to resolve the "Agent not found in the arena: trust" error.

## Changes Made
1. Added trust agent definition to forge.default.yaml
2. Configured trust agent with:
   - ID: trust
   - Title: "Balanced assistant"
   - Model: Uses the same advanced_model as forge and muse agents
   - System prompt: Uses forge-system-prompt-engineer-act.hbs template
   - Tools: Comprehensive tool set including all core tools plus task management tools
   - Reasoning: Enabled for enhanced capabilities

## Agent Configuration Details
The trust agent is configured as a general-purpose assistant that:
- Works effectively with both cloud and local AI models
- Provides comprehensive tool access for file operations, web browsing, and shell commands
- Serves as the default agent for general interactions and local model testing
- Handles diverse requests without specific implementation or planning constraints

## Expected Resolution
With this implementation, the following should now work without errors:
1. `/model select qwen2.5:1.5b` - Should complete without "Agent not found" error
2. `/model select mistral:latest` - Should complete without "Agent not found" error
3. `/trust` command - Should switch to the trust agent successfully
4. Local AI model conversations - Should work with the trust agent as the default

## Verification Steps
To test this implementation:
1. Start the trust-ai application
2. Run `/model list` to see available local models
3. Run `/model select qwen2.5:1.5b` (or another local model)
4. Verify no "Agent not found in the arena: trust" error occurs
5. Test conversation functionality with the selected local model
6. Run `/trust` to verify agent switching works

## Technical Notes
- The trust agent uses the same system prompt template as the forge agent
- It includes all standard tools plus task management capabilities
- The configuration follows the same pattern as existing agents
- No code changes were required, only configuration updates
