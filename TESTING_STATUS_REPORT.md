# Trust-AI Testing Status Report

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING

### ‚úÖ What Works
1. **Basic CLI functionality**
   - `trust-ai --help` - Works perfectly
   - `trust-ai --version` - Works perfectly  
   - `trust-ai -p "prompt"` - Works perfectly (can answer questions)

### ‚ùå What's Broken
1. **All model commands hang in interactive mode**
   - `/model list` - Hangs after banner display
   - `/model status` - Hangs after banner display
   - `/model health` - Hangs after banner display
   - `/model discover` - Hangs after banner display
   - `/model select` - Hangs after banner display

### üîç Root Cause Analysis
- Trust-AI starts correctly and displays banner
- Application enters interactive mode successfully
- **Hang occurs when processing any `/model` command**
- Issue appears to be in model command processing logic
- Not related to ollama availability (ollama works fine independently)

### üß™ Testing Methodology Validation

#### ‚úÖ CORRECTED: Using trust-ai CLI interface
```bash
# CORRECT - Using trust-ai CLI with /model commands
trust-ai -c commands.txt
# where commands.txt contains:
/model discover
/model list
/model select ollama/qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

#### ‚ùå PREVIOUS INCORRECT: Direct ollama commands  
```bash
# INCORRECT - This was the flawed approach
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b "prompt"
```

### üîß Immediate Next Steps
1. **Investigate model command processing logic**
   - Check provider initialization in crates/forge_provider/
   - Review model command handlers in crates/forge_main/src/
   - Look for async operations that might be blocking

2. **Alternative testing approach**
   - Use direct prompt mode for functionality testing
   - Bypass interactive model commands until fixed
   - Focus on core AI functionality validation

### üìä Test Results Summary
- **Basic functionality**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **AI prompt processing**: ‚úÖ WORKING  
- **Interactive mode startup**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Model commands**: ‚ùå HANGING
- **Ollama integration**: ‚ùì UNKNOWN (blocked by model command hang)

### üéØ Recommendation
The testing methodology correction was successful - we now use the proper trust-ai CLI interface. However, there's a critical bug in the model command processing that needs to be fixed before comprehensive testing can proceed.

The application can process AI prompts successfully, indicating the core functionality works, but model management commands are broken.
