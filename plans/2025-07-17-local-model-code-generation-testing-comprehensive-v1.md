- **Accuracy**: Correct tool selection for each task
- **Efficiency**: Minimal tool calls to achieve objectives
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from tool failures
- **Format Compliance**: Proper JSON schema adherence

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Syntax Correctness**: Code compiles/runs without syntax errors
- **Functional Completeness**: Implements all specified requirements
- **Best Practices**: Follows language conventions and standards
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear comments and documentation

### Performance Indicators
- **Response Time**: Time from prompt to completion
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU consumption during generation
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful task completions
- **Consistency**: Reproducibility across multiple runs

## Sample Test Prompts

### Basic File Operations
```
Create a Python script that reads a CSV file and generates a summary report. Save the script as 'data_analyzer.py' and create a sample CSV file with test data.
```

### Web Development
```
Build a simple task management web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Create separate files for each technology and ensure the application can add, display, and remove tasks.
```

### System Administration
```
Create a Bash script that monitors system resources and logs the results. Include configuration file support and error handling. Organize the files in a proper directory structure.
```

### Code Refactoring
```
Here's a Python function that needs optimization [provide code]. Refactor it to improve performance and readability while maintaining the same functionality. Save the improved version and document the changes.
```

## Verification Criteria
- All identified models successfully download and initialize
- Test scenarios execute without system errors
- Tool calls generate valid JSON and successful file operations
- Generated code passes syntax validation for target languages
- Performance metrics collected consistently across all test runs
- Results documented in standardized format for comparison
- Resource usage remains within acceptable system limits

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Model Download and Storage Requirements**
   - Risk: Large models may exceed available disk space or take excessive time to download
   - Mitigation: Start with smallest capable models, monitor disk usage, provide clear storage requirements

2. **Inconsistent Tool Call Generation**
   - Risk: Local models may struggle with proper JSON formatting for tool calls
   - Mitigation: Include tool call format validation, provide clear examples in prompts, implement retry logic

3. **Context Window Limitations**
   - Risk: Complex tasks may exceed model context limits, leading to incomplete responses
   - Mitigation: Design tests within known context limits, break complex tasks into smaller components

4. **Performance Variability**
   - Risk: Local model performance may vary significantly based on system resources
   - Mitigation: Establish baseline performance requirements, test on multiple system configurations

5. **Code Quality Inconsistency**
   - Risk: Generated code quality may vary unpredictably between similar prompts
   - Mitigation: Use multiple test runs for each scenario, establish quality thresholds, focus on reproducible patterns

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Focused Single-Model Deep Testing**: Concentrate testing on one proven model with extensive scenario coverage rather than broad model comparison
2. **Progressive Complexity Testing**: Start with simplest scenarios and gradually increase complexity based on success rates
3. **Tool-Specific Testing**: Focus primarily on tool integration accuracy rather than code quality assessment
4. **Comparative Cloud Model Baseline**: Include cloud model results as performance benchmarks for local model evaluation
5. **User-Driven Scenario Testing**: Collect real-world use cases from developers and test against those specific scenarios

## Expected Outcomes

This testing framework will provide:
- Quantitative assessment of local model code generation capabilities
- Clear guidance on which models perform best for specific coding tasks
- Validated tool integration patterns for reliable local AI development
- Performance baselines for future model evaluations
- Comprehensive documentation enabling reproducible testing workflows

The results will inform model selection recommendations, identify areas for system optimization, and establish confidence levels for local AI-assisted development workflows.
