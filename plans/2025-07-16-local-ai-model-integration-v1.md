# Local AI Model Integration for Trust CLI

## Objective

Transform the forked Code Forge CLI into a local-first AI development assistant that prioritizes private AI models from Ollama and HuggingFace, while maintaining intelligent fallback to cloud providers. The goal is to provide developers with a privacy-focused, high-performance AI coding assistant that runs primarily on local infrastructure.

## Recommended Approach

**Implementation Priority**: Ollama-First
- Simpler HTTP integration with faster time to value
- Build local foundation first, then add HuggingFace complexity
- Better user experience with immediate local inference

**Cloud API Strategy**: Minimal Privacy-First
- **Keep**: OpenRouter (multi-model access) + Anthropic (high quality)
- **Document & Preserve**: OpenAI (maintain code for potential future restoration)
- **Remove**: Forge, Requesty, XAI (reduce privacy exposure)
- **Result**: Primary local (Ollama/HuggingFace) + minimal cloud fallback

## Implementation Plan

### 6. **Implement Local Model Configuration System**
- Dependencies: Task 4
- Notes: Extend YAML configuration to support local model preferences, model discovery, and performance tuning parameters

- Status: Not Started

### 7. **Create Intelligent Provider Fallback Logic**
- Dependencies: Task 6
- Notes: Implement local-first provider selection with automatic fallback to cloud providers when local models unavailable
- Files: `crates/forge_provider/src/client.rs`, `crates/forge_app/src/`, provider selection logic

### 8. **Enhance CLI for Local Model Management**
- Dependencies: Task 7
- Notes: Add commands for model listing, selection, status checking, and configuration management
- Files: `crates/forge_main/src/`, new CLI command modules, model management interface
- Status: Not Started

### 9. **Implement Model Discovery and Health Checking**
- Dependencies: Task 8
- Notes: Automatic detection of available Ollama models, health checking for local services, model availability reporting
- Files: Model discovery services, health check implementations, status reporting
- Status: Not Started

### 10. **Add Comprehensive Testing for Local Providers**
- Dependencies: Task 9
- Notes: Unit tests for new providers, integration tests for fallback logic, mock services for testing
- Files: Test files across all modified crates, mock Ollama server, test fixtures
- Status: Not Started

### 11. **Performance Optimization and Monitoring**
- Dependencies: Task 10
- Notes: Optimize local model loading times, implement response time monitoring, add performance metrics
- Files: Performance monitoring modules, optimization code, metrics collection
- Status: Not Started

### 12. **Create Migration Guide and Documentation**
- Dependencies: Task 11
- Notes: User migration guide from cloud-only to local-first setup, updated README and configuration documentation
- Files: README.md, migration guides, configuration examples, API documentation
- Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- **Compilation Success**: All code compiles without errors using `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`
- **Test Suite Passes**: All existing tests continue to pass, new tests for local providers pass
- **Ollama Integration**: Successfully connects to local Ollama instance and performs inference
- **Fallback Functionality**: Gracefully falls back to cloud providers when local models unavailable
- **Configuration Management**: Users can configure local model preferences via CLI and YAML
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Local inference response times meet or exceed cloud provider performance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing cloud provider configurations continue to work without modification
- **Documentation Completeness**: All new features documented with examples and migration guides

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### 1. **Architecture Mismatch Between Vision and Implementation**
**Risk**: Vision documents describe TypeScript/Node.js implementation but codebase is Rust
**Mitigation**: Adapt vision concepts to Rust ecosystem using equivalent libraries and patterns, maintain user experience goals while optimizing for Rust strengths

### 2. **Local Model Performance and Resource Usage**
**Risk**: Local models may have high memory usage or slow inference times
**Mitigation**: Implement model size recommendations, provide performance tuning options, add resource monitoring and warnings

### 3. **Complex Fallback Logic Implementation**
**Risk**: Intelligent fallback between local and cloud providers may introduce bugs or unexpected behavior
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of fallback scenarios, clear user feedback about which provider is being used, simple override mechanisms

### 4. **HuggingFace Integration Complexity**
**Risk**: Native GGUF model loading in Rust may be complex or unstable
**Mitigation**: Start with Ollama integration (simpler HTTP), research multiple Rust AI libraries, consider external process communication as fallback

### 5. **Configuration System Complexity**
**Risk**: Supporting both local and cloud providers may make configuration complex
**Mitigation**: Provide sensible defaults, clear configuration examples, migration tools from existing setups

### 6. **Dependency Management and Build Complexity**
**Risk**: AI libraries may introduce large dependencies or complex build requirements
**Mitigation**: Use feature flags for optional dependencies, provide pre-built binaries, clear build documentation

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **External Process Approach**
Use external processes for local AI inference (similar to MCP integration), communicating via JSON/HTTP. This would isolate AI dependencies and allow reuse of existing tools.

### 2. **Plugin Architecture**
Implement a plugin system where local AI providers are separate dynamic libraries, allowing for easier updates and optional installation.

### 3. **Gradual Migration Strategy**
Implement only Ollama integration initially as a proof-of-concept, then add HuggingFace support in a subsequent phase based on user feedback and technical learnings.

### 4. **Cloud-First with Local Enhancement**
Maintain cloud providers as primary with local models as an advanced/optional feature, reducing complexity for typical users while providing privacy options for advanced users.
