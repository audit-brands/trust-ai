- Focus: Architecture validation and core domain model extensions
- Success Criteria: Clean compilation, clear architecture understanding

**Priority Level 2: Core Integration (Phases 4-6)**
- Primary value delivery through Ollama integration
- Focus: Working local AI inference with basic configuration
- Success Criteria: Functional local model communication

**Priority Level 3: Enhanced Experience (Phases 7-9)**
- User experience improvements and reliability features

- Success Criteria: Production-ready local-first experience

**Priority Level 4: Optimization (Phases 10-12)**
- Performance, testing, and documentation completion
- Focus: Polish, monitoring, and user adoption support
- Success Criteria: Optimized, well-tested, documented system

### Decision-Making Criteria

#### Technical Risk Assessment
1. **Complexity Score** (1-5): How complex is the implementation?
2. **Dependency Impact** (1-5): How many other phases depend on this?
3. **User Value** (1-5): How much immediate value does this provide?
4. **Risk Level** (1-5): What's the likelihood of implementation challenges?

#### Focus Determination Process

**Step 1: Current State Validation**
- Run compilation checks: `cargo check --workspace`
- Run test suite: `cargo test --workspace`
- Verify existing provider functionality
- Document any existing issues or technical debt

**Step 2: Phase Readiness Assessment**
For each phase, evaluate:
- Are dependencies completed?
- Do we have sufficient technical understanding?
- Are there any blocking unknowns?
- Is the scope well-defined?

**Step 3: Resource and Time Estimation**
- Estimate implementation time for each ready phase
- Consider available development resources
- Factor in learning curve for new technologies
- Plan for testing and documentation time

**Step 4: Value vs. Effort Analysis**
- Prioritize phases with high user value and low complexity
- Defer phases with high complexity until dependencies are solid
- Consider quick wins that build momentum

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks

**Architecture Mismatch**
- Mitigation: Dedicate Phase 2 to Rust-specific architecture design
- Validation: Create proof-of-concept implementations before full development
- Fallback: Adapt TypeScript concepts rather than direct translation

**Local Model Performance**
- Mitigation: Implement performance monitoring from Phase 6 onward
- Validation: Benchmark against cloud providers throughout development
- Fallback: Provide clear guidance on model selection and hardware requirements

**Complex Fallback Logic**
- Mitigation: Start with simple fallback in Phase 6, enhance in Phase 7
- Validation: Comprehensive testing of fallback scenarios
- Fallback: Provide manual override options for problematic cases

### Project Risks

**Scope Creep**
- Mitigation: Strict adherence to phase boundaries and success criteria
- Validation: Regular review of implementation scope vs. original plan
- Fallback: Defer non-essential features to future iterations

**Technical Debt Accumulation**
- Mitigation: Include refactoring time in each phase
- Validation: Code review and quality checks at phase boundaries
- Fallback: Dedicated cleanup phases if technical debt becomes problematic

## Success Metrics and Checkpoints

### Phase Completion Criteria

**Every Phase Must Achieve**:
- Clean compilation with no warnings
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New functionality has corresponding tests
- Code meets project quality standards

**Milestone Checkpoints**:
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Local AI domain model established
- **Phase 6 Complete**: Basic local AI inference working
- **Phase 9 Complete**: Production-ready local-first experience
- **Phase 12 Complete**: Optimized, documented, ready for adoption

### Quality Gates

**Technical Quality**:
- Rust clippy passes with no warnings
- Test coverage maintains current levels
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Security review for local model handling

**User Experience Quality**:
- Configuration remains simple and intuitive
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Fallback behavior is predictable and reliable
- Documentation supports successful adoption

## Adaptation Strategy

### When to Pivot

**Technical Blockers**:
- If Ollama integration proves more complex than expected, consider external process approach
- If HuggingFace native integration is too complex, defer to future iteration
- If performance doesn't meet requirements, focus on optimization earlier

**User Feedback**:
- If users prefer different model management approaches, adapt CLI design
- If configuration complexity becomes problematic, simplify and provide better defaults
- If fallback behavior is confusing, enhance user feedback and control

### Iteration Planning

**After Phase 6 (Basic Ollama Integration)**:
- Gather user feedback on basic functionality
- Assess technical approach effectiveness
- Adjust remaining phases based on learnings

**After Phase 9 (Enhanced Experience)**:
- Evaluate overall user experience
- Identify optimization priorities
- Plan final polish and documentation focus

**After Phase 12 (Complete Implementation)**:
- Plan future enhancements based on user adoption
- Consider additional local AI providers
- Evaluate opportunities for community contributions

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Validate current state and architecture analysis
2. **Create Technical Specifications**: Document detailed requirements for each phase
3. **Set Up Development Environment**: Ensure all necessary tools and dependencies
4. **Establish Feedback Loops**: Plan for regular progress assessment and adaptation
5. **Start Implementation**: Begin with foundation phases and build momentum

This methodology provides the framework for systematic execution of the local AI integration plan while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on technical discoveries and user feedback.
