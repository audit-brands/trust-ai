# Ollama Model Acquisition Workflow Clarification

## Objective
Clarify and document the complete model acquisition workflow for Trust AI users, specifically addressing whether Ollama CLI is required for model downloads or if Trust AI can facilitate model acquisition through its existing shell tool capabilities.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. **Analyze Current Model Download Workflow**
- Dependencies: None
- Notes: Examine existing error handling and shell tool integration to understand current capabilities
- Files: `crates/forge_provider/src/ollama/error.rs`, `crates/forge_services/src/tool_services/shell.rs`, `crates/forge_domain/src/tools.rs`
- Status: Not Started

**Analysis Focus:**
- Current error message guidance in `crates/forge_provider/src/ollama/error.rs:181`
- Shell tool capabilities defined in `crates/forge_domain/src/tools.rs:297`
- Command execution infrastructure in `crates/forge_services/src/tool_services/shell.rs`

### 2. **Document Shell Tool Capabilities for Model Management**
- Dependencies: Task 1
- Notes: Clarify that Trust AI can execute `ollama pull` commands through its shell tool
- Files: Documentation files, error message improvements
- Status: Not Started

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Trust AI's `ForgeToolProcessShell` can execute any shell command including `ollama pull`
- Shell tool includes safety measures with restricted bash (rbash) by default
- Users can enable unrestricted mode with `-u` flag for full command access

### 3. **Design Enhanced Error Handling with Actionable Commands**
- Dependencies: Task 1, Task 2
- Notes: May require user input on permission model and automation level preferences
- Files: `crates/forge_provider/src/ollama/error.rs`, potentially new workflow components
- Status: Not Started

**Enhancement Options:**
- Provide executable shell commands that users can approve
- Offer to execute `ollama pull {model}` directly through Trust AI
- Maintain current instructional approach but clarify Trust AI's capabilities

### 4. **Implement Workflow Integration Options**
- Dependencies: Task 3
- Notes: Based on user preferences, implement either automatic suggestions or enhanced guidance
- Files: Error handling, potentially new service components
- Status: Not Started

**Integration Approaches:**
- **Conservative**: Enhanced documentation with clear workflow guidance
- **Progressive**: Interactive model download assistance through shell tool
- **Automated**: Proactive model download suggestions with user consent

### 5. **Create Comprehensive Model Acquisition Documentation**
- Dependencies: Task 4
- Notes: Document complete workflow including Trust AI's shell capabilities
- Files: User documentation, troubleshooting guides
- Status: Not Started

**Documentation Scope:**
- Complete model acquisition workflow from detection to download
- Trust AI's shell tool capabilities for Ollama commands
- Best practices for model management with Trust AI
- Troubleshooting guide for common model acquisition scenarios

### 6. **Verification and Testing**
- Dependencies: All previous tasks
- Notes: Test model download workflows and error scenarios
- Files: Test files, integration tests
- Status: Not Started

**Testing Coverage:**
- Model not found error scenarios
- Shell tool execution of `ollama pull` commands
- User workflow validation from error to resolution
- Documentation accuracy verification

## Verification Criteria
- Users understand Trust AI can execute Ollama commands through its shell tool
- Clear documentation of complete model acquisition workflow
- Enhanced error messages provide actionable guidance
- Workflow testing confirms end-to-end functionality
- User experience improved for model management tasks

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### 1. **User Workflow Confusion**
**Risk**: Users may not understand whether Trust AI can automatically download models or if manual Ollama CLI is required
**Mitigation**: Create clear documentation distinguishing between Trust AI's shell capabilities and direct Ollama integration, provide step-by-step workflow guidance

### 2. **Security and Permission Concerns**
**Risk**: Automatic model downloads could consume significant bandwidth/storage without explicit user consent
**Mitigation**: Implement clear user consent mechanisms, provide download size estimates, offer manual approval for large operations

### 3. **Shell Tool Capability Misunderstanding**
**Risk**: Users may not realize Trust AI's shell tool can execute Ollama commands
**Mitigation**: Enhance error messages to explicitly mention shell tool capabilities, provide examples of Trust AI executing Ollama commands

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Documentation-Only Approach**
Enhance existing documentation and error messages to clarify Trust AI's shell capabilities without modifying core functionality. Focus on user education about existing tools.

### 2. **Interactive Model Management**
Implement interactive workflows where Trust AI proactively offers to execute model download commands through its shell tool, with user approval for each operation.

### 3. **Automated Model Acquisition**
Develop automatic model download functionality that integrates directly with Ollama, bypassing the need for explicit shell commands while maintaining user control.
