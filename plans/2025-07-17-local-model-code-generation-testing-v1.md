# Local Model Code Generation and Tool Usage Testing Plan

## Objective
Create a comprehensive testing framework to evaluate local Ollama models' capabilities for code generation, file creation, and practical tool usage within the Trust AI system. This plan builds on the successful Qwen directory detection test and the existing Phase 10 testing infrastructure to provide systematic evaluation of local models' coding effectiveness.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Current Testing Infrastructure**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Leverage existing Phase 10 testing suite with 58+ tests and mock services infrastructure
   - Files: `crates/forge_app/src/tool_executor.rs`, Phase 10 test modules, existing mock services
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Design Code Generation Test Scenarios**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Create comprehensive scenarios covering file creation, multi-step coding tasks, and tool integration patterns
   - Files: Test scenario definitions, code generation templates, validation criteria
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement Local Model Test Framework**
   - Dependencies: Task 1, 2
   - Notes: Build framework that can test both real Ollama models and mock responses for CI/CD compatibility
   - Files: Local model test framework, enhanced mock services, test utilities
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create File Creation and Code Quality Tests**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3
   - Notes: Test various file types, code correctness, compilation success, and functional accuracy
   - Files: File creation test modules, code quality validators, compilation checkers
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Develop Tool Integration Workflow Tests**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4
   - Notes: Test multi-step workflows combining file operations, searches, patches, and shell commands
   - Files: Workflow test scenarios, integration test modules, tool chain validators
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Implement Performance and Reliability Metrics**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4, 5
   - Notes: Track success rates, response times, tool call accuracy, and error recovery patterns
   - Files: Performance monitoring, metrics collection, reliability analysis
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Create Model Comparison and Benchmarking**
   - Dependencies: Task 4, 5, 6
   - Notes: Compare local models against each other and establish baseline capabilities for different coding tasks
   - Files: Benchmarking framework, comparison reports, capability matrices
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Develop Test Execution and Reporting System**
   - Dependencies: Task 6, 7
   - Notes: Automated test execution with detailed reporting and analysis of local model capabilities
   - Files: Test runner, reporting dashboard, analysis tools, documentation
   - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Local models can successfully execute file creation tools with valid parameters
- Generated code compiles and functions correctly for target languages
- Multi-step tool workflows complete successfully with logical progression
- Tool call JSON parsing works consistently across different local models
- Performance metrics show acceptable response times for practical usage
- Error handling and recovery work effectively with local model limitations
- Test framework provides actionable insights for model selection and optimization

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Local Model Tool Call Inconsistency**
   Mitigation: Create robust JSON parsing validation and provide multiple tool call format examples in test scenarios

2. **Code Quality Variation Across Models**
   Mitigation: Implement multi-tier validation including syntax checking, compilation testing, and functional verification with clear quality thresholds

3. **Performance Bottlenecks with Local Models**
   Mitigation: Design tests with configurable timeouts and performance baselines, allowing for slower local model response times while maintaining usability standards

4. **Context Window Limitations**
   Mitigation: Design test scenarios that respect typical local model context limits and test context management strategies for complex workflows

5. **Model Availability and Setup Complexity**
   Mitigation: Create comprehensive mock services for CI/CD testing and provide clear setup documentation for local development testing

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Focused Depth Testing**: Concentrate on specific coding scenarios most relevant to Trust AI workflows rather than broad coverage
2. **Cloud Model Comparison**: Include cloud model baselines in testing to quantify local model trade-offs
3. **User Simulation Testing**: Create realistic user interaction patterns rather than isolated tool testing
4. **Incremental Capability Testing**: Start with basic file operations and progressively test more complex coding scenarios
