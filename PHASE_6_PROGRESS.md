# Phase 6: Configuration System and Provider Fallback

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive configuration system for local model management and intelligent provider fallback logic to ensure reliable user experience when local models are unavailable.

## Phase Status: ðŸŸ¡ READY TO START

## Requirements

### 1. Local Model Configuration System
- [ ] Create configuration structure for local model preferences
- [ ] Implement model discovery and availability checking
- [ ] Add configuration validation and defaults
- [ ] Support for model-specific parameters (temperature, context length, etc.)
- [ ] User preference persistence and management

### 2. Intelligent Provider Fallback Logic
- [ ] Implement fallback hierarchy (local â†’ cloud providers)
- [ ] Add health checking for local services
- [ ] Create graceful degradation when local models unavailable
- [ ] Provide user notification and control over fallback behavior
- [ ] Maintain conversation context across provider switches

### 3. Configuration Management
- [ ] Extend existing forge.yaml configuration system
- [ ] Add CLI commands for configuration management
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and error handling
- [ ] Support for environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Migration support for existing configurations

### 4. Provider Selection Logic
- [ ] Implement intelligent provider selection algorithm
- [ ] Add manual provider override capabilities
- [ ] Create provider capability matching (streaming, models, etc.)
- [ ] Implement load balancing for multiple local instances
- [ ] Add provider performance monitoring

## Technical Specifications

### Configuration Schema Extension
```yaml
# forge.yaml additions
local_ai:
  enabled: true
  providers:
    ollama:
      enabled: true
      endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
      preferred_models:
        - "llama3.2:latest"
        - "codellama:latest"
      fallback_enabled: true
      health_check_interval: 30s
  
  fallback:
    strategy: "graceful" # graceful, immediate, manual
    cloud_providers:
      - "openai"
      - "anthropic"
    notify_user: true
    max_retries: 3
```

### Provider Selection Algorithm
1. Check local provider availability and health
2. Verify model availability for current request
3. Apply user preferences and configuration
4. Implement fallback logic if local provider unavailable
5. Maintain conversation context across provider switches

### Health Checking System
- Periodic health checks for local services
- Model availability verification
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Automatic provider status updates
- User notification of status changes

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Configuration System Foundation
- [ ] Design configuration schema for local AI settings
- [ ] Extend existing configuration parsing and validation
- [ ] Create configuration management utilities
- [ ] Add unit tests for configuration handling

### Week 2: Provider Fallback Logic
- [ ] Implement provider health checking system
- [ ] Create fallback decision engine
- [ ] Add provider switching capabilities
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation logic

### Week 3: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate configuration system with existing providers
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Validate configuration migration and compatibility

### Week 4: CLI and User Experience
- [ ] Add CLI commands for configuration management
- [ ] Implement user notifications for provider switches
- [ ] Create configuration validation and help system
- [ ] Add documentation and usage examples

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Provider abstraction layer familiarity

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
1. **Configuration Complexity**: Risk of overly complex configuration options
   - Mitigation: Start with minimal viable configuration, expand based on user needs
   - Provide sensible defaults and clear documentation

2. **Fallback Performance**: Risk of slow or unreliable fallback behavior
   - Mitigation: Implement fast health checks and caching
   - Provide manual override options for problematic cases

3. **Context Loss**: Risk of losing conversation context during provider switches
   - Mitigation: Design context preservation mechanisms
   - Test thoroughly with various conversation scenarios

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Risk of adding too many configuration options
   - Mitigation: Focus on core use cases first, defer advanced features
   - Regular review of implementation scope vs. requirements

2. **User Experience Complexity**: Risk of confusing configuration options
   - Mitigation: Extensive user testing and feedback collection
   - Provide clear documentation and examples
