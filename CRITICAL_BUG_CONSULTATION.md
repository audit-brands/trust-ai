# Critical Bug Consultation Document

## Executive Summary

The trust-ai CLI has a **critical usability bug** where all `/model` commands hang indefinitely after displaying the banner, blocking all model-related functionality. This document provides comprehensive context for external AI consultation (Claude/Gemini) to help resolve this blocking issue.

## Background Context

### Project Overview
- **trust-ai**: Rust-based CLI tool for AI model interaction
- **Architecture**: Multi-provider system supporting Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic
- **Current Status**: Basic functionality works, model commands completely broken

### Testing Methodology Correction
Previously attempted direct ollama commands, but corrected to proper trust-ai CLI interface:
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `trust-ai /model list`
- ‚ùå **Incorrect**: `ollama list` (bypasses trust-ai entirely)

## Critical Bug Details

### Symptoms
1. **Hang Location**: After banner display, before any model processing
2. **Affected Commands**: ALL `/model` commands (`/model list`, `/model set`, etc.)
3. **Working Commands**: Basic functionality (`trust-ai --help`, file operations)
4. **Environment**: Ollama backend operational with 3 models available

### Confirmed Working Components
```bash
# Basic CLI functionality ‚úÖ
trust-ai --help
trust-ai --version

# Ollama backend ‚úÖ  
ollama list  # Shows 3 models: llama3.2:latest, qwen2.5-coder:latest, deepseek-coder-v2:latest
ollama serve  # Running on localhost:11434
```

### Failing Pattern
```bash
# All these hang after banner ‚ùå
trust-ai /model list
trust-ai /model set llama3.2:latest
trust-ai /model
```

## Technical Analysis

### Suspected Root Causes
1. **Provider Initialization**: Async operation deadlock during Ollama provider setup
2. **Configuration Loading**: Hanging during model discovery or config validation  
3. **Network Operations**: Timeout or blocking call to Ollama API
4. **Threading Issues**: Deadlock in async runtime or thread pool

### Key Code Areas to Investigate
Based on codebase structure:

1. **Model Command Processing**:
   - `crates/forge_main/src/model.rs` - Model command handling
   - `crates/forge_app/src/orch.rs` - Orchestration layer

2. **Provider Integration**:
   - `crates/forge_provider/src/ollama/` - Ollama provider implementation
   - `crates/forge_services/src/provider_registry.rs` - Provider registration

3. **Async Operations**:
   - Any tokio runtime initialization
   - HTTP client setup for Ollama communication
   - Model discovery operations

## Environment Details

### System Configuration
- **OS**: Linux
- **Rust**: Latest stable
- **Ollama**: Running on localhost:11434
- **Available Models**: 3 models confirmed working with direct ollama commands

### Configuration Files
- `forge.yaml` - Main configuration
- `forge.default.yaml` - Default settings

## Previous Investigation Attempts

### Debugging Steps Tried
1. ‚úÖ Verified ollama backend operational
2. ‚úÖ Confirmed basic trust-ai CLI works
3. ‚úÖ Isolated issue to model command processing
4. ‚úÖ Created test scripts to reproduce consistently
5. ‚ùå Need deeper code investigation for root cause

### Test Scripts Created
- `test_basic_functionality.sh` - Confirms working components
- `test_model_commands.sh` - Reproduces hanging behavior
- `demonstrate_corrected_testing.sh` - Shows proper testing approach

## Consultation Request

### Primary Question
**What is causing all `/model` commands to hang after banner display, and how can we fix it?**

### Specific Areas for Analysis
1. **Async/Threading**: Are there deadlocks in the async runtime or thread pools?
2. **Provider Initialization**: Is the Ollama provider hanging during setup?
3. **Network Operations**: Are HTTP calls to Ollama timing out or blocking?
4. **Configuration**: Is model discovery or config loading causing the hang?

### Code Review Focus
Please examine these critical paths:
- Model command entry points and routing
- Ollama provider initialization sequence
- Async operation setup and execution
- Configuration loading and validation
- HTTP client setup and API calls

### Expected Deliverables
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Specific location and reason for the hang
2. **Fix Strategy**: Concrete steps to resolve the issue
3. **Prevention**: How to avoid similar issues in the future
4. **Testing**: Verification approach for the fix

## Priority Level

üö® **CRITICAL** - This bug completely blocks model functionality, making the CLI unusable for its primary purpose. Users cannot resort to direct ollama commands as they bypass trust-ai entirely.

## Repository Information

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/audit-brands/trust-ai
- **Latest Commit**: f22166dd (testing methodology corrections)
- **Branch**: main

## Next Steps

1. External consultation with Claude/Gemini using this document
2. Implement recommended fixes
3. Verify resolution with test scripts
4. Update documentation and testing procedures
